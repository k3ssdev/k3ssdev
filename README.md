ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Alberto PÃ©rez, also known as @k3ssdev.

ðŸ‘€ I'm deeply interested in open source software, everything related to the Linux ecosystem, the fascinating world of ethical hacking, and the cutting-edge advancements in Artificial Intelligence.

ðŸ’¼ I currently work as a Data Engineer in the R&D department of an Engineering and Architecture consultancy here in Spain. My daily work involves a really interesting Artificial Intelligence project, where we apply techniques like Bayesian Weibull analysis, Petri Nets, and Bayesian Neural Networks.
